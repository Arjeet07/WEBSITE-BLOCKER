# WEBSITE-BLOCKER

This is a real world program which block user-specified websites during user's working time.

# Language
 Python
 
# Usage
You can either manually run the Python script in your command line(Windows) or terminal(Linus/Mac), or better yet, simply schedule a daemon and let the script run once the computer starts. My program is intended to be run (be active) all the time.

# What you will see when the website you are trying visit is blocked
